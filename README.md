# US-Sales-dataset-report
I made report of U.S sales dataset. Used different charts to show the information.
Performed Data cleaning and mining in power query and removed
blancked rows and null values. Relaced rows name with similar one to
keep it simple. Made model relationship even more efficient for data
flow. Did data visualization with the help of DAX and shown the total
unit price and top and bottom customers, and used pie chart to show
the average percentage of unit price.
